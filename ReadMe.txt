1.all my code are in .ipynb format, you can use any google colab to upload the file and run it
2.I did not set a fraction variable in the Random Sampling algorithm and SON algorithm, so if you want to change the fraction of dataset randomly selected or how many chucks that dataset sliced to, you need to change my code manualy, changing the number for calculating threshold and other variable(I am so sorry for this)
3.If you want to change the threshold to different percentage like 1% to 2%, change the min_support varible value
